I can\\'t think of many things I would not do or at least attempt. I\\'ve been skydiving and would totally go again. I love snakes, rats, 99% of insects and other creepy crawlies. I grew up riding horses and playing Jackass with my cousins and siblings, doing the dumbest stunts that usually resulted in someone getting hurt and laughing it off. I\\'m extremely adventurous sexually. I\\'ve been a stripper. I\\'ve swam with sharks. I\\'ve eaten things that people would vomit just looking at for funsies or as a dare. I have tattoo and piercings. I\\'ve lopped off all my hair and gave myself a 3\" mohawk with practically BIC\\'d sides. I\\'ve survived a 15 year heroin/poly substance addiction and have died and been revived. I\\'ve gone cliff jumping into water and freehand rock climbing in precarious environments. \\n\\nI think maybe the only thing I would *not* do is that crazy Russian heroin-homebake krokodil shit that rots limbs. I probably would not handle or otherwise fuck with venomous centipedes.\\n\\nAnd a big one - I have never volunteered at an animal shelter, even though I\\'ve been working with dogs for 23 years (15 years as a dog trainer, working with aggressive dogs with bite histories; I\\'ve also been a groomers aide, kennel tech, and dog walker) and if the shelters keep up their current trend of warehousing aggressive and dangerous dogs, I never will. SO many workers have been mauled and killed by dogs they were working with in the shelter. Some had known aggressive tendencies, others attacked or killed out of the blue with no prior warning. There is no safety net for shelter workers. If you get mauled, too bad, you\\'re on your own both financially and physically. Injured workers are made to pay their own medical bills when attacked and are very often blamed by the public and their fellow employees. Due to the West\\'s unhealthy, unrealistic relationship with domestic canines, victims are blamed and any assumed act of provocation, something as simple as someone sneezing, is used to justify people being viciously attacked and maimed. As an animal professional and animal lover, the anthropomorphism bestowed on dogs by the naive general public is infuriating and disheartening to the point a lot of good and knowledgeable animal professionals quit their jobs. We just can\\'t deal with the wilful ignorance of the general public. I get asked for training advice constantly, ignored, and then six months later they come crawling back apologizing for not listening and begging for more advice, which I now choose to deny them. Our skills are valuable, we gave you free advice that should have costed you and you chose to ignore it. \\n\\nSo when animal professionals worth a damn tell it like it is and tell you a dog is dangerous and should be put down, it makes our blood boil to see the advice ignored and someone ends up hurt, which happens all too often. Even then, killer and dangerous dogs have their behavior excused and everyone else blamed. Just Google \"animal shelter workers mauled or killed\" and see what pops up, it\\'s astounding.\\n\\nUntil shelters wisen up and start giving a damn about public safety over their adoption numbers, I will not donate to them, I will not recommend any of their dogs to adopters. I will not volunteer, and I will not adopt nor advocate adoption to anyone considering it.\\n\\n*Steps off soapbox*\\n\\n\\nBut yeah anything else is pretty much on the table'], [0, 0, 1, Redditor(name='1chriabowers'), 'Cocaine'], [0, 0, 1, Redditor(name='1_scoopsxahoy_1'), 'Being straight.'], [0, 0, 1, Redditor(name='megaknighttoes'), 'Trying to suck my own dick, almost broke my neck trying'], [0, 0, 1, Redditor(name='Forward_Camp2'), 'Swinger Club'], [0, 0, 1, Redditor(name='VampireRae'), 'Anything harder than marijuana or alcohol.

It's much better than meth, but to be honest it's not all that worth it either. But I think coke isn't the worst if you avoid addiction. Just don't expect something like alcohol or cannabis where it really hits you. They are both much more similar to what you get from caffeine, only not as intense. \\n\\nIf you have ever tried Adderall or Ritalin, or taken anything with Pseudophedrin in it, congratulations you pretty much know what it feels like to have clean meth. Most meth feels like a dirtier version of that. \\n\\nIn all these cases there is definitely a serious boost in motivation beyond what you get from standard caffeine. That's really the main appeal. You get that and a dopamine rush that does feel good.\\n\\nLike most drugs though whatever you get now, you are basically borrowing from your future at high interest. When you do a stimulant, you feel good and motivated, but tomorrow you feel more unmotivated, tired and apathetic.

My friend group were the typical HS kids - we hung out in parking lots and stayed out of trouble for the most part.  Started smoking weed a bit after HS and gradually got into other things.  I don't remember exactly how we made that jump, but I know we'd dabbled in coke just a little bit.   Coke was hard to find and growing up in a small southern town, meth was always available. (I'd like to refute one thing you said - meth isn't cheaper - or at least it wasn't back then.  But a small amount would last hours and hours, where coke is a few minutes.)  \\n\\nAt the same time we were experimenting with things, my sister's boyfriend was selling meth - small scale dealer at that time.  I guess it was just one night we wanted some coke and couldn't find any, so I called my sister's boyfriend.  For me, drugs were never my thing - I would occasionally do them, but the uppers just weren't a feeling I was looking for.  My friends though, they seemed to really like them and would ask me to get them something and eventually they started hanging around with sketchier crowds that had their own.  \\n\\nAnyway - around this same time, I started dating this girl and we both moved away for college.  I was 23 or so, burned out at my job and enrolled in an engineering program on the other end of my state.  At that time, my friends were mainly drinkers/potheads *for the most part*..  A wild weekend and something crazier may come out, but they primarily stuck to drinking and weed.  I'd come home every couple of weeks to hang out with them and we'd always do the normal things.  And as I found new friends in my new town, I started coming home less.  After 2 years, I broke up with my girlfriend and was offered a job back home - it would involve 6 months of training back in my hometown.  I was kind of depressed and I took it, thinking it'd be good to reconnect with my old friends.  \\n\\nNo joke - I can still remember my first weekend back.  My friends seemed more distant and we were having fun, but a few of them kept sneaking off occasionally.  They knew me - no reason to hide what they were doing, so I was confused.   We'd been partying in my buddy's backyard and I walked inside to use the bathroom or something and I remember seeing this broken lightbulb with a burn mark on it.  I started looking around and there were several lightbulbs that looked exactly the same way.  I sort of put 2 and 2 together and asked what was up and that's when they sheepishly told me they'd started smoking meth.   Not all of them - but maybe 4 out of my 6-8 closest friends.  For all the stuff I've done, I've never done that.  But I didn't plead with them or anything - just said for them to be careful and that was it.  \\n\\nIn the end, I moved back to my college town and still live here today (15 years later).   That same friend group - they're fractured in half - the meth heads and the potheads.  The meth guys are all still alive, but they've all been in and out of prison - for wild stuff.  Arson, bank robbery, kidnapping and things - stuff I never would have expected from friends I grew up with - all good kids from good homes.   I *think* they're starting to clean themselves up, from what I can tell - we're all in our 40's now.  And they're all still alive surprisingly.

He would use the app Grindr which is a gay dating app (he was secretly gay ) and within the gay community a large portion of them use the drug ice , or meth as it’s known. He met up with a guy and the guy introduced him to it, I don’t know why he did it , he’s not stupid and like I said a couple years ago before the mental illness he would snitch on me for having a vape, but at the same time if never had gone through that mental\\nEpisode he would never of been in the position where he would have someone offering it to him, he would be surrounded by lawyers and educated people. \\nIn my case, being young and looking upto my older cousin , keep in mind , he is now this totally new person who does drugs , and me always being the rebel , (I did weed nothing hard thkugh ) I enjoyed hanging out with him , I was always around it and even when I’d be at home I’d think about what it was like to try it ?
